It is designed to be your&nbsp;indispensable assistant in the daily task of collecting numerous pieces of information, whatever they may be:&nbsp;your&nbsp;own thoughts and ideas, book and article excerpts, job postings, famous quotes, research data, curious facts,&nbsp;Wikipedia definitions, blog posts, important news, you name it.</p><p class="hyphenate">It lets you quickly jot down and tag any piece of useful information that you come across while reading&nbsp;documents or surfing the Net - just select the text and press Ctrl+F12. With CintaNotes, this is really all it&nbsp;takes to make a note! CintaNotes does not clutter your desktop with "sticky notes", all notes are neatly&nbsp;organized in an easily navigable list. And unlike browser-based tools like Google Keep or Firefox plug-ins&nbsp;CintaNotes does not require a web browser to work - it works with Microsoft Word, Outlook, Adobe Acrobat - the&nbsp;"text-capturing magic" works with all applications that can copy text to clipboard!</p><p class="hyphenate">Retrieving information is also trivial: just open CintaNotes and start typing, and only notes which contain the&nbsp;text you type will remain in the list. More sophisticated search criteria are also supported, like searching by&nbsp;title or by URL the note was taken from.</p><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes is a totally portable application, meaning that you can put it on a flash drive and run it directly&nbsp;from there - in this way, your notes will always be with you.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="sysreq"> System Requirements</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes runs under Microsoft Windows® XP and above.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="install"> Installing, Licensing and Updating</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><h3 id="install-1">Installation</h3><p class="hyphenate">To install CintaNotes:</p><ol><li>In your web browser, click the link to the program.</li><li>To install the program immediately, click "Open" or "Run", and then follow the instructions. If you're&nbsp;prompted by Windows User Access Control for an administrator password,   type&nbsp;the password.<img class=" size-full wp-image-2771 aligncenter" src="./help_files/install012.png" alt="install01" width="444" height="346"></li><li>Click "Next" and then accept the end-user license agreement.<br> <img class=" size-full wp-image-2774 aligncenter" src="./help_files/install032.png" alt="install03" width="543" height="429"></li><li>Select the folder where CintaNotes will reside ("Program Files\CintaNotes" by default). You can choose a&nbsp;different folder by clicking the "Browse" button.<br> <img class=" size-full wp-image-2777 aligncenter" src="./help_files/install042.png" alt="install04" width="543" height="429"></li><li>Then you'll be asked for the Start Menu folder name. You'll only want to change it if you already have the&nbsp;start menu folder with this name,&nbsp;e.g when installing multiple instances of CintaNotes.<br> <img class=" size-full wp-image-2780 aligncenter" src="./help_files/install062.png" alt="install06" width="543" height="429"></li><li>After the installation is complete, click "Launch CintaNotes" and then "Finish" to get rolling.<br> <img class=" size-full wp-image-2783 aligncenter" src="./help_files/install072.png" alt="install07" width="543" height="429"></li></ol><p class="note box hyphenate">Please pay attention that if you install CintaNotes into the Program Files folder, your note&nbsp;data&nbsp;and program settings will be stored separately in "%APPDATA%\<em>CintaNotes</em>". Simple copying&nbsp;of the&nbsp;application folder will copy just the application itself, without your data. You can find and copy your data&nbsp;files manually.</p><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes can also work without installation. For your convenience there also is a portable&nbsp;version of CintaNotes available for direct download from the official site, which doesn't contain an&nbsp;installer.</p><h3 id="install-2">License</h3><p class="hyphenate">By default, CintaNotes is installed under the terms of the Basic (Free) License. But some advanced features are&nbsp;initially locked, and&nbsp;only get unlocked upon upgrading to the PRO license. These features include:</p><ul><li>Simplenote synchronization</li><li>Password protection</li><li>Multiple notebooks support</li><li>More than 3 tabbed sections</li><li>Linking notes with each other</li><li>Tag hierarchy and expandable tag tree</li><li>Exporting notes to HTML format</li><li>Pasting notes into other applications</li></ul><p class="hyphenate">You don't have to download a separate package after purchasing a license. There is just one distribution of&nbsp;CintaNotes.&nbsp;Registering a license unlocks premium functionality in the program that is already installed. The PRO license is&nbsp;intended&nbsp;both for non-commercial and commercial (business) environments.</p><p class="hyphenate">To obtain a PRO License, select the <em>License</em> command from the <em>Help menu</em>.&nbsp;The "Buy" button in the License window will take you to the online order page.</p><p class="tip box hyphenate">You can also request a 10 day trial key to try out the PRO features without buying the license.&nbsp;Click on the "Trial" button and you will be redirected to our website for completing a simple request form.&nbsp;Shortly after submitting this form you will receive the trial key delivered to your email.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2786 aligncenter" src="./help_files/license_obtain2.png" alt="license_obtain" width="628" height="338"></p><p class="hyphenate">After your order is processed, you will receive your registration key by email (usually takes several minutes,&nbsp;but in extremely rare cases can take up to 12 hours). You can enter the registration details into the <em>Help/License&nbsp;</em>window in one of three ways:</p><ul><li>Option 1: Select the whole purchase confirmation email text, and clip it using the configured clipping hot&nbsp;key (Ctrl+F12 by default) -&nbsp;this is the recommended approach;</li><li>Option 2: Copy the email content to clipboard and then open the <em>License</em> window;</li><li>Option 3: Manually enter the registration details into the <em>License</em> window.</li></ul><p class="warning box hyphenate">Please make sure that the data in the "Registration Name and E-Mail" and "Registration Key"&nbsp;fields exactly&nbsp;matches the data in the license key email. Whitespace and parentheses make a difference!</p><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes is licensed per user, so you can use the same license key on all your PCs. But the license key&nbsp;needs to be registered on every PC separately.</p><h3 id="install-3">Updating CintaNotes to newer versions</h3><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes automatically checks for updates and indicates to you that a new version is available with a yellow&nbsp;information bar under the main menu.&nbsp;Click on this bar to download the new version package.<br> <img class=" size-full wp-image-2789 aligncenter" src="./help_files/update022.png" alt="update02" width="553" height="500"><br> You can also check for updates manually with the <em>Help/Check for Updates</em> command. The same window allows&nbsp;you to turn off the automatic update check in case you don't want to be notified.<br> <img class=" size-full wp-image-2792 aligncenter" src="./help_files/update012.png" alt="update01" width="456" height="265"><br> After downloading the updated package, usually all you need to do is point the installer to your CintaNotes&nbsp;folder.<br> <img class=" size-full wp-image-2795 aligncenter" src="./help_files/cn_update012.png" alt="cn_update01" width="395" height="406"></p><p class="hyphenate">To update the portable version, unpack the archive and copy the new files over the old content of the CintaNotes&nbsp;folder.</p><p class="hyphenate">Updating a registered version of CintaNotes (i.e. with a PRO License) will automatically transfer the license key&nbsp;to the new version. Unless you've purchased a Lifetime PRO license, your license key will be valid only for&nbsp;CintaNotes versions released during the 12 months since the date of purchase. If you update to a version&nbsp;released after this date, it will run with PRO features disabled.&nbsp;In order to continue using the PRO features, you will have to either go back to an earlier CintaNotes version,&nbsp;renew your license and extend your updates subscription for another year, or upgrade to a Lifetime PRO&nbsp;license.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="taking"> Taking notes</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes provides you with several ways to take notes. You can enter notes manually, clip text from other&nbsp;applications, or paste text from clipboard.</p><h3 id="taking-1">Entering notes manually</h3><p class="hyphenate">Open CintaNotes and select the "New Note" command from the "Edit" menu (or just press the Ins key&nbsp;or Ctrl+N). CintaNotes creates a new note and displays the note editor. In this window you can enter a note's&nbsp;title, text, tags, link and also add some additional remarks.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2799 aligncenter" src="./help_files/edit_new_note2.png" alt="edit_new_note" width="540" height="460"></p><p class="hyphenate">The note's Link is just some URL associated with the note, e.g. "<a href="http://cintanotes.com/">http://cintanotes.com</a>".</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2803 aligncenter" src="./help_files/note_link2.png" alt="note_link" width="523" height="373"></p><p class="hyphenate">The link can be entered manually, but most of the time it is filled automatically on clipping text from other&nbsp;applications (see next section). If CintaNotes recognizes the contents of the "Link" field to be a valid URL, it&nbsp;displays it as a clickable link. Clicking on this icon will open the URL in your default browser. (Note: The URL&nbsp;can also be a link to a file on your computer, in which case CintaNotes will attempt to open that file in the&nbsp;default application for that file type.)</p><p class="note box hyphenate">There is also a "Browse Link" command in a note's context menu, which enables you to browse the&nbsp;note's URL without opening the note editor.</p><p class="hyphenate">The "Tags" field is used to categorize notes (see "Using tags to categorize notes" section below).</p><p class="hyphenate">The "Remarks" field is intended as a place for additional information. Oftentimes the main note text is clipped&nbsp;from somewhere, and in the Remarks field you can specify some notes to yourself. Please note that the height of&nbsp;this field adjusts automatically to the amount of text you enter into it, but you can also adjust it manually&nbsp;via dragging the lower edge of the main text area with the mouse.</p><p class="hyphenate">None of these fields are required and may be left blank. After you've entered the information you want to keep,&nbsp;press "OK" (or Ctrl+Enter) to add the note to your notebook.</p><h3 id="taking-2">Clipping text from other applications</h3><p class="hyphenate">Entering notes manually is great if you want to write down some brilliant ideas of your own, but often you will&nbsp;just want to store a piece of information you've found somewhere else. This is a case where CintaNotes really&nbsp;shines.</p><p class="hyphenate">Provided CintaNotes is running in the background (usually it will reside in the system tray), all you need to do&nbsp;is mark the text you want to store and press Ctrl+F12. Et voilà! CintaNotes' main window pops up, focused&nbsp;on the new note with the text you've just selected. Some fields besides text are also filled automatically - the&nbsp;title of the source application window is taken as note's title, and if you clip text from a web page, the&nbsp;note's Link field automatically receives the URL of the page from the address bar of your browser (Internet&nbsp;Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari are supported).</p><p class="hyphenate">At this moment you might want to edit the new note to add remarks to it or tag it. Pressing Esc minimizes&nbsp;CintaNotes and you can continue reading where you left off.</p><h3 id="taking-3">Pasting notes from the clipboard</h3><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes also supports direct text pasting from the Windows clipboard. Select the "Paste" command from the&nbsp;"Edit" menu or press Ctrl+V. CintaNotes creates a new note with the text from the clipboard. It also tries to&nbsp;determine which application has put the data into the clipboard, and if successful, it uses the application&nbsp;window&nbsp;title as the note's title. Unfortunately, reliable clipboard data source detection is not always possible, and&nbsp;when&nbsp;CintaNotes fails to find the source window, the first line of the pasted text becomes also the note's title.</p><p class="hyphenate">If you are pasting a note that was inserted to the Clipboard from CintaNotes, the Title, Tags and date&nbsp;information will be copied from the original note in addition to the note content.</p><p class="tip box hyphenate">It is recommended that you use clipping instead of clipboard pasting as much as possible,&nbsp;because in the former case more data can be filled automatically for you.</p><h3 id="taking-4">Editing notes</h3><p class="hyphenate">You can go back to editing any note at anytime - just double-click on it, or highlight it and press the Enter&nbsp;(or F2) key.</p><p class="hyphenate">For the main note content, CintaNotes supports basic text formatting with the help of the <em>Format&nbsp;</em>pop up submenu. Bold, italics, underline, strikeout, monospace and highlighting are supported. Also you can&nbsp;make bulleted and numbered lists.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2806 aligncenter" src="./help_files/format_text2.png" alt="format_text" width="567" height="596"></p><h3 id="taking-5">Deleting notes</h3><p class="hyphenate">Deleting notes is also straightforward - select the notes you want to delete, and press the Delete key (or&nbsp;select "Delete" from the "Edit" menu or the note's context menu).</p><p class="hyphenate">By default, deleted notes go into the Recycle Bin, which belongs to the notebook and is accessible from the File&nbsp;menu. But you can also delete notes permanently with the Shift+Del shortcut.</p><p class="warning box hyphenate">Take care when deleting notes permanently, CintaNotes currently does not provide the&nbsp;possibility to undo this operation.</p><h3 id="taking-6">Merging notes</h3><p class="hyphenate">Quite often when you are reading some long text and making notes along the way, you end up with a whole bunch of&nbsp;short notes on the same topic. But in many cases what you really want is just one note with all the text&nbsp;you've collected so far.</p><p class="hyphenate">In CintaNotes you can merge such notes together via selecting all of them and choosing the "Edit/Merge"&nbsp;command (or pressing Ctrl+M). The selected notes will be merged into one.</p><p class="note box hyphenate">The "Merge" command is also accessible from the note's context menu. It is enabled only when&nbsp;two or more notes are selected.</p><h3 id="taking-7">Editing note properties</h3><p class="hyphenate">When you select the "Properties" menu item from the note's context menu (or press Alt+Enter), CintaNotes&nbsp;displays the note properties window. With this window you can edit the note's timestamps, and see the note's&nbsp;text size in KB.</p><p class="hyphenate">The same window is accessible from the note editor when you click on the timestamps.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2809 aligncenter" src="./help_files/note_properties2.png" alt="note_properties" width="340" height="317"></p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="finding"> Finding Notes</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><h3 id="finding-1">Simple search</h3><p class="hyphenate">By default, CintaNotes displays all notes which are in the notebook, organized in a list. You can enter a search&nbsp;query to limit the display to the notes satisfying the query. To begin&nbsp;entering the search string, just start typing in the main CintaNotes window. The focus will go to the search&nbsp;box,&nbsp;and the note list will be updated as you type.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2814 aligncenter" src="./help_files/search_simple3.png" alt="search_simple" width="553" height="615"></p><p class="hyphenate">When you search, CintaNotes highlights parts of notes which matched your search. Additionally you&nbsp;can use the F3 and Shift+F3 keys on the focused note's text preview to navigate forward and backward through&nbsp;the highlighted matches (the same keys also work in the note editor window for searching selected text).</p><p class="hyphenate">Search strings are not case-sensitive. To reset the search filter and go back to the full list, click the&nbsp;<em>'X'</em> (close) button inside of the search box, or press Esc. Adding a new note will reset the search&nbsp;filter&nbsp;as well.</p><h3 id="finding-2">Search query syntax</h3><p class="hyphenate">The following search query syntax is supported by CintaNotes:</p><ul><li><code>word1 word2</code> matches all notes that contain both words in any order;</li><li><code>word1 -word2</code> matches notes that have word1 but do not have word2;</li><li><code>word1 word2|word3</code> matches notes that have word1 and have either word2 or word3;</li><li><code>"word1 word2"</code> will display only notes that contain the verbatim string "word1 word2";</li><li>different combinations of the above also work: <code>"word1 word2" | word3 -word4</code> will<br> display notes without word4 which have either "word1 word2" or word3.</li></ul><p class="note box hyphenate">This extended query syntax works only for note title and text.</p><p class="hyphenate">If you'd like to limit the search to only certain data fields, CintaNotes has a number of search modes which&nbsp;allow you do exactly this.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2817 aligncenter" src="./help_files/search_simple_modes2.png" alt="search_simple_modes" width="553" height="615"></p><p class="hyphenate">In the "Anywhere" mode, which is the default, CintaNotes includes all fields in the search. The following&nbsp;additional search modes are available:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><em>Any Text Field</em></td><td>Search in any of the following fields: Title, Text, Tags or Remarks.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Text and Title</em></td><td>Search in the Title or in the Text fields.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Text Only</em></td><td>Search in the Text field only.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Title Only</em></td><td>Search in the Title field only.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Creation / Modification Time</em></td><td>Search by note's creation / modification date and time.Keep in mind that the search is still text based, so you can enter "11/" to list all notes created /<br> modified in November (if your system uses the US time format), but you'll also see the notes created<br> / modified on 11th day of any other month. To find all November notes you should search for<br> "/11/".</td></tr><tr><td><em>Link</em></td><td>Search in the "Link" field only.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Remarks</em></td><td>Search in the "Remarks" field only.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Tags</em></td><td>Search in the "Tags" field. This is the search mode you use when you wish to list all notes having<br> particular tags.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="finding-3">Searching inside words</h3><p class="hyphenate">By default, CintaNotes searches only from the word boundaries. This means that e.g. when you search for&nbsp;<code>nation</code>, notes containing the word "international" won't be found. If you want to search also&nbsp;inside of words, you need to activate the "Search inside words" option by clicking on the magnifying glass&nbsp;icon (or simply right-clicking) in the search box, and selecting the "Search inside words" item from the&nbsp;drop-down menu.</p><p class="warning box hyphenate">The "Search inside words" option makes search much slower, especially when the number and&nbsp;size of notes is large. So it is best to use it only when you can't find what you need with the default&nbsp;search.</p><h3 id="finding-4">Searching across field boundaries</h3><p class="hyphenate">By default, all search terms must be inside of one field to produce a match. For example, when you search for&nbsp;"foo bar", notes which have "foo" in the title and "bar" in the Link field won't appear. But if you activate the&nbsp;"Search across field boundaries" option in the search context menu, the note will be found. This is because when&nbsp;this option is on, the search operates as if all selected fields were joined into one text field, which is&nbsp;searched.</p><p class="warning box hyphenate">Note that searching across field boundaries is not active by default since it negatively&nbsp;impacts search performance. Like searching inside words, it's best to use this option only on as-needed&nbsp;basis.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="viewing"> Previewing and Reading Notes</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes displays a note's text directly in the notes list. The number of the text lines which are displayed&nbsp;is controlled by the <em>Options/Notes List</em> window.</p><p class="hyphenate">If a note's text is too long to fit into the preview, a small arrow indicator is displayed in the lower right&nbsp;corner. With the Left and Right arrow keys you can scroll the currently focused note's text directly in the&nbsp;preview. The indicator by default points right, indicating that pressing the Right arrow key will show more&nbsp;text. After you start scrolling, it will change to a double-sided arrow when there is text both before and after&nbsp;the visible segment, and finally, to a left arrow when you reach the end.</p><p class="hyphenate">Pressing Ctrl+Left or Right arrow keys scroll the text by page. You can also "pin" the note using spacebar (or&nbsp;left mouse click), and then the preview text can be scrolled with all usual navigation keys or mouse wheel.</p><p class="hyphenate">If you want to read the note more comfortably, you can press 'Enter' or 'F2' to open the note in the editor.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="managing"> Managing Notes</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><h3 id="managing-1">Using Tags to categorize Notes</h3><p class="hyphenate">When you take notes every day, having all of them in a single list becomes unmanageable very quickly. Note tags&nbsp;are used to address this problem. While editing a note, you can specify any text in the note's "Tags" field.&nbsp;Later&nbsp;you can use part of this text to quickly filter out notes which don't contain it in their "Tags" field, thus&nbsp;greatly narrowing down your search.</p><p class="hyphenate">For example, you might decide to tag notes as a ToDo list with a "ToDo" tag.&nbsp;So every time you take such a note, you put "ToDo" into the "Tags" field. After that this tag will appear on&nbsp;the Tag Sidebar (see the screenshot below), so you will be able to highlight it, and CintaNotes will display&nbsp;just your&nbsp;ToDo notes. Alternatively, you can turn on Tag Search (see "Finding notes" section) and type "ToDo" as your&nbsp;search string.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2822 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tag_sidebar2.png" alt="tag_sidebar" width="588" height="473"></p><p class="hyphenate">If you want to associate two or more tags with a note, just put them all into the "Tags" separated by spaces&nbsp;(comma and semicolon can also be used but will be automatically converted to spaces).</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2825 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags013.png" alt="tags01" width="567" height="415">Tags can include symbols, not just alphanumeric characters, i.e. "#1!" is a valid tag. Remember&nbsp;also that tags are not case-sensitive.</p><p class="hyphenate">It is possible to tag several notes at once: just select them and press F4 (or select the <em>Tag...&nbsp;</em>command from the context menu).</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2828 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags_add_remove2.png" alt="tags_add_remove" width="594" height="500"></p><p class="hyphenate">The <em>Edit/Replace Tags</em> command allows tag renaming, splitting, merging and deleting. Generally, each tag&nbsp;specified in the first edit box is replaced with all tags from the second edit box.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2831 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags_replace4.png" alt="tags_replace" width="440" height="323"></p><h3 id="managing-2">Tag auto-completion</h3><p class="hyphenate">In any tag entering field CintaNotes displays a drop down list of available tags as soon as you start typing.&nbsp;Pressing Spacebar, Enter or Tab accepts the currently highlighted suggestion, whereas Esc or Del cancels it. You&nbsp;can also force auto-complete display by pressing Ctrl+Space.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2834 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tag_autocomplete2.png" alt="tag_autocomplete" width="567" height="428"></p><h3 id="managing-3">Using the Tag Sidebar</h3><p class="hyphenate"><em>Tag Sidebar</em> is a handy tool for fast access to different tags and tag sets.</p><p class="hyphenate">The sidebar is not displayed by default, you can turn it on using the <em>View/Tag Sidebar</em> menu&nbsp;command.</p><p class="hyphenate">There is a list of clickable labels on the sidebar. The first two labels are "All" and "Untagged", they are&nbsp;predefined and cannot be changed. When you click on the "All" label on the sidebar, you make sure that no tags&nbsp;filter is applied. The "Untagged" label will display only notes having no tags.</p><p class="hyphenate">Here's an example of using CintaNotes for creating a small dictionary&nbsp;with technical terms:</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2837 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tag_sidebar_labels2.png" alt="tag_sidebar_labels" width="553" height="481"></p><p class="tip box hyphenate">The <em>Untagged</em> label is your natural note inbox which gives you quick and convenient&nbsp;access to recently captured information that needs to be categorized (provided you are using tags, of course).</p><p class="hyphenate">Directly below is the list of all tags defined in the notes. This list displays all tags in alphabetical&nbsp;order. If the list is long and doesn't fit, two scroll buttons appear (you can also scroll this list using the&nbsp;mouse wheel, and this is probably the most convenient way).</p><p class="hyphenate">To the right of each tag is the number of notes in the current notebook which have that tag applied.&nbsp;This allows you to easily see which tags are underused and can be merged or removed. Tag count display can&nbsp;be turned off in <em>Options / Tags</em> menu.</p><p class="hyphenate">Clicking on a tag activates it, and only notes having this tag will be displayed. Using Ctrl+Click or&nbsp;Shift+Click, you can expand the tag selection to additional tags. Keep in mind that with Ctrl+Click, a <em>tag&nbsp;intersection</em> is used when multiple tags are selected (i.e. notes having <em>all</em> of the selected&nbsp;tags will&nbsp;be included), whereas with Shift+Click, a <em>tag union</em> is used (i.e. notes having <em>any</em> of the tags&nbsp;will be included).</p><p class="hyphenate">There is also a possibility to <em>exclude</em> (subtract) tags from the set via Alt-clicking on them. The&nbsp;excluded tags will show as strikeout with a bluish background. Only the notes which have been selected via tag&nbsp;union or&nbsp;tag intersection tags, and which additionally don't have any of the excluded tags, will be shown in the list.</p><p class="hyphenate">Tags selected in tag union mode have a yellowish highlight, whereas tag intersection tags will have the normal&nbsp;white highlight.

As you switch selected<br> tags, the tags are<br> updated to display only related ones. Two tags are related if there exists a note which has both of them.<br> (So by definition these are tags which have use count greater than zero.)</li></ul><p class="note box hyphenate">It is also possible to activate the "Only Related" mode by double-clicking the tag name. But&nbsp;since this collides with the usual tree collapse / expand actions, you need to enable this explicitly via&nbsp;setting the "app.mainframe.tagsidebar.doubleclick.onlyrelated" parameter of the cintanotes.settings file to&nbsp;1.</p><h3 id="managing-4">Editing tag properties</h3><p class="hyphenate">To view and edit the properties of a tag, right-click it in the Tag Sidebar and select "Properties".</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2855 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags_properties2.png" alt="tags_properties" width="360" height="221"></p><p class="hyphenate"><em>Delete automatically</em> - When this option is set, tag will be automatically deleted when there&nbsp;are no more notes with this tag. Tags created via the "Tags" field of the note editor have this option set&nbsp;by default.</p><p class="hyphenate"><em>Expanded by default</em> - Applicable to parent tags only. When this option is set, the tree branch&nbsp;will be automatically expanded when the notebook is loaded. This enables you to keep commonly used&nbsp;child tags always visible.</p><h3 id="managing-5">Tag Hierarchy</h3><p class="hyphenate">To further enhance the organization of your notes using tags, tags can be organized into a hierarchic structure.<br> Such a tree-like structure is very useful for creating various taxonomies.</p><p class="hyphenate">Why organize your Tags into a tree? There are two main benefits derived from organizing tags into trees:</p><ol><li>You can easily generalize and specialize tags. For example, where you might use tags <em>todo</em>, <em>reply&nbsp;</em>and <em>watch</em>, you can instead use <em>todo/reply</em> and <em>todo/watch</em>. <em>todo</em> becomes a&nbsp;parent tag in this case.&nbsp;By selecting this tag on the sidebar, you can see all things you need to do, regardless of the type of&nbsp;action that needs to be taken. Without tag hierarchy, you would need to select all these tags one by one&nbsp;to get the same result.</li><li>When you have a lot of tags, it quickly becomes difficult to manage them and to find them on the sidebar.&nbsp;If your tags are organized into groups by parent tags, you can easily locate the tags you need.</li></ol><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2858 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags_hierarchy022.png" alt="tags_hierarchy02" width="588" height="453"></p><p class="hyphenate">Creating a tag hierarchy is simple. Just create tags with forward slashes in their names, for example&nbsp;<em>Cars/Sportcars/Ferrari</em>, <em>Projects/MyProj1</em> or <em>GDP/Europe/UK</em>. To create a hierarchy from&nbsp;existing tags,&nbsp;rename them (e.g. rename <em>Sportcars</em> to <em>Cars/Sportcars</em> and <em>Ferrari</em> to <em>Cars/Sportcars/Ferrari</em>).</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2861 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags_hierarchy013.png" alt="tags_hierarchy01" width="665" height="415"></p><p class="hyphenate">Due to the parent/child relationship, when you add a tag such as <em>movies/comedy</em> to a note, actually&nbsp;two tags are added: <em>movies</em> and <em>movies/comedy</em>. And when you delete a tag from a note,&nbsp;any child tags are deleted from that note automatically.</p><p class="hyphenate">Tags are always referred to by their full name (with all parent tags as a prefix), so you can't write&nbsp;<em>comedy</em> and&nbsp;expect CintaNotes to understand that you really mean <em>movies/comedy</em>. This might seem limiting at first,&nbsp;however in reality&nbsp;it is not, since with tag auto complete you don't have to write these long tag names by hand.&nbsp;For example, to enter <em>movies/comedy</em>, you type "co" or "com" and then select <em>movies/comedy</em> from&nbsp;the suggestions list.</p><p class="hyphenate">The most important thing to understand about tags in CintaNotes, is that when tag <em>A</em> is a parent,&nbsp;and tag <em>B</em> is its child, tag <em>B</em> is really called <em>A/B</em> and in all places will be referred&nbsp;as such. Tag <em>B</em> would refer to a tag named simply <em>B</em> (i.e. on the top hierarchy level).&nbsp;This means that both tags <em>B</em> and <em>A/B</em> can exist at the same time and they are different tags.</p><p class="hyphenate">Moving tags around the hierarchy is also accomplished by renaming them. Renaming tags is done by right clicking<br> on the tag in the Tag Sidebar and selecting the "Rename" option from the menu.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2864 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags_replace5.png" alt="tags_replace" width="440" height="323"></p><p class="hyphenate"><strong>Example 1:</strong> Given the tag hierarchy <em>A/B/C</em>, to move tag <em>C</em> to the top level,&nbsp;rename <em>A/B/C&nbsp;</em>to <em>C</em>.</p><p class="hyphenate"><strong>Example 2:</strong> Given the tag hierarchy <em>A/B/C</em>, to move tag <em>C</em> to the second level,&nbsp;rename <em>A/B/C&nbsp;</em>to <em>A/C</em>.</p><p class="hyphenate"><strong>Example 3:</strong> Given the tag hierarchy <em>A/B/C</em>, to make tag <em>A</em> child of some other&nbsp;tag <em>D</em>, rename <em>A</em> to <em>D/A&nbsp;</em>(note that children of <em>A</em> will be renamed automatically, so the whole hierarchy will become&nbsp;<em>D/A/B/C</em>).</p><p class="hyphenate">New child tags can be created by right clicking on the tag that you want to be the parent in the Tag Sidebar and&nbsp;selecting the "New Child" option from the menu.&nbsp;(Note that this is a convenience option, since the same can be done via selecting the "New..." entry of the Tag&nbsp;Sidebar context menu and specifying the full child tag name.)</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2867 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tags_new_child_create2.png" alt="tags_new_child_create" width="360" height="176"></p><p class="note box hyphenate">Tag hierarchy is supported in all license options of CintaNotes. However the tag hierarchy tree&nbsp;view is only available to PRO License holders. This allows you to view your tag&nbsp;relationships as trees, with parent nodes at the top and child nodes beneath.

As a further time saver, the notebooks are numbered, allowing you to use keyboard shortcuts, so typing&nbsp;Alt+F, 2 will&nbsp;change to the second notebook in the list. A notebook can be removed from the list by opening that notebook and&nbsp;selecting&nbsp;the <em>File / Close</em> menu item.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2876 aligncenter" src="./help_files/notebook_open2.png" alt="notebook_open" width="598" height="462"></p><p class="hyphenate">This allows you to keep separate notes for different research projects you may be working on.

When CintaNotes creates a new notebook, it also creates a section called "Main".&nbsp;Right-clicking on a tab in the Section bar brings up a context menu which contains all section-related&nbsp;commands.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2880 aligncenter" src="./help_files/section_bar2.png" alt="section_bar" width="596" height="448"></p><p class="hyphenate">The <em>Create New Section</em> command adds a new section to the notebook.

You can change the&nbsp;section's color by clicking on the little colored box beside the "Color" field in the "Create Section" dialog&nbsp;window.<br> Please note that the final tab color can differ from what you've picked: to ensure comfortable brightness and&nbsp;contrast levels, only the hue of the selected color is used.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2884 aligncenter" src="./help_files/section_create2.png" alt="section_create" width="370" height="221"></p><p class="hyphenate">To rename a section, or to change its properties, use the <em>Properties</em> command in the section tab's&nbsp;context menu.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2887 aligncenter" src="./help_files/section_properties2.png" alt="section_properties" width="596" height="448"></p><p class="hyphenate">Deleting a section is possible through the <em>Delete</em> command of the same menu, or via pressing&nbsp;Ctrl+Shift+Del.&nbsp;Mind that all notes the section contains will be deleted and unrecoverable.&nbsp;If you want to delete the section but keep the notes, you should first move the notes to another section via&nbsp;selecting&nbsp;them and executing the <em>Edit/Move/To Section</em> command (Shift+F6).</p><p class="hyphenate">You can change the position of the section tabs with the <em>Move Left</em> (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Left Arrow) and&nbsp;<em>Move Right&nbsp;</em>(Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Right Arrow) commands.</p><h3 id="sections-2">Using sections</h3><p class="hyphenate">Sections should be used for unrelated sets of data when you want to create&nbsp;a distinct separation. Here are a few examples of correct section usage:</p><ul><li>Separating private notes from notes related to work;</li><li>Separating notes related to different unrelated work or private projects;</li><li>Creating a temporary "place of chaos" for collecting information on a specific topic, which you<br> don't want to mix with your notes and intend to process later;</li><li>Variations of the above.</li></ul><p class="hyphenate">In other cases it would probably be better to use tags.</p><h3 id="sections-3">Section view state</h3><p class="hyphenate">In CintaNotes, each section maintains its own view state, which includes note sorting order and tag selection.&nbsp;(Note that search parameters are not considered part of a section's view state and are shared between sections.)&nbsp;When you switch between sections, the view state parameters are saved and restored on the fly. This enables&nbsp;you to define the most convenient sorting order for each section, or create a predefined tag selection&nbsp;which will be activated each time you switch to that section.</p><h3 id="sections-4">Selecting multiple sections</h3><p class="hyphenate">What do you do if you want to find something, but you don't remember in which section it was?&nbsp;What if you need to temporarily combine notes from two sections?</p><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes solves these problems via supporting multiple section selection.&nbsp;You can Ctrl+Click on a tab, and this tab will be added to the current selection instead of&nbsp;replacing it. Notes from this tab will be added to the notes list.</p><p class="hyphenate">What is necessary to remember here is that the first section that was selected is the&nbsp;"main" section that defines the view state (the sorting order and search parameters).</p><p class="hyphenate">The Ctrl+Shift+Space shortcut, or "Select All" command in the section's context menu, allows you to quickly&nbsp;select all sections. This can be useful when you don't remember exactly the needed section and want to search&nbsp;your whole notebook, for example.</p><h3 id="sections-5">The Inbox section</h3><p class="hyphenate">An important question is the following: to which section do notes created with system-wide hotkeys, such as the&nbsp;clipping hotkey, or new note hotkey, go to?</p><p class="hyphenate">By default such notes go to the currently active section. If multiple sections are active, then they go to the&nbsp;section which was selected first (the "host" section).</p><p class="hyphenate">However, this requires you always to remember which section is currently active, even when CintaNotes may have&nbsp;been minimized to tray hours ago — sometimes this may be less than ideal. It may be more convenient to&nbsp;have a designated "inbox" section to accommodate such notes. And in CintaNotes you do just that: mark one of&nbsp;the sections as an Inbox section.</p><p class="hyphenate">A section can be marked as Inbox with the "Set as Inbox" context menu command, or simply via middle-clicking&nbsp;on the section's tab. Also the active section can be set as Inbox by pressing Ctrl+I. The Inbox section tab has&nbsp;a special icon.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2890 aligncenter" src="./help_files/tabs_inbox_set2.png" alt="tabs_inbox_set" width="596" height="309"></p><p class="hyphenate">When there exists a section marked as Inbox, new notes created from the system-wide hotkeys go to the&nbsp;Inbox section even when it is not active.</p><p class="hyphenate">Please note that this applies only for notes created with system-wide hotkeys! The rules are different for notes&nbsp;created via the <em>Edit/New</em> command (or via pressing the Ins or Ctrl+N key in the main window). In this&nbsp;case, CintaNotes assumes that since you're currently looking at the notes list and working with a specific&nbsp;section, you'd also want for new notes to be created in the currently active section, regardless which section&nbsp;is marked as Inbox (if any).</p><p class="hyphenate">(For the sake of completeness, there is one case when the Inbox status is used outside of the system-wide&nbsp;context: if&nbsp;multiple sections are active, and the Inbox section is among them, the notes will go to the Inbox section&nbsp;and not to the "host" section.)</p><h3 id="sections-6">Sections and Tags</h3><p class="hyphenate">Tags are global and shared between all sections. So don't be surprised if you see a lot of tags with&nbsp;a use count of zero when you create a new section.</p><p class="hyphenate">There's an easy way to reduce the clutter here. By activating the "Used Only" tag filter mode in the&nbsp;Tag Sidebar's context menu you'll only see the tags which are present in the currently selected sections&nbsp;(that is, only tags assigned to notes from selected sections will be displayed).</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="sync"> Synchronizing Notes</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><p class="hyphenate">If you work on multiple PCs, e.g at home and at work, or want to have your notes always at&nbsp;hand on your mobile device, you will probably want your notes to be automatically synchronized.&nbsp;CintaNotes supports two kinds of synchronization: via the <a href="http://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> service&nbsp;and via <a href="http://dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>.</p><h3 id="sync-1">Simplenote Synchronization</h3><p class="note box hyphenate">Simplenote synchronization is a commercial feature available only to PRO license holders.</p><p class="hyphenate"><a href="http://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> is an online service for notes which allows any application to&nbsp;share and synchronize notes over the cloud.

Configuring for other synchronization&nbsp;services like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, or SugarSync is similar.</p><p class="hyphenate">Moving CintaNotes program and settings files into the Dropbox folder is NOT recommended because:</p><ul><li>The backup files will constantly be "conflicted";</li><li>You won't be able to have separate settings on different PCs.</li></ul><p class="hyphenate">You don't have to close CintaNotes for your notes to be synchronized. After the period of inactivity&nbsp;of 30 seconds, CintaNotes releases the notebook file lock. But please allow some time (usually about 2-10&nbsp;minutes,&nbsp;depending on your internet connection) for a full synchronization cycle.</p><p class="hyphenate">Please note that if you take notes offline, or shutdown the computer right after you've created some notes,&nbsp;these last notes may not be synchronized, and if you then take notes on another PC, conflicts might arise. With&nbsp;DropBox, you will notice them with the appearance of the "conflicted copy" notebook files alongside your&nbsp;notebook file. If you see these files, you will need to merge them back into your main notebook file.</p><p class="hyphenate">To do that use the <em>File / Import...</em> command on this conflicted file. The import command filters out&nbsp;duplicate notes automatically, so that you will only get the notes that you don't have. This&nbsp;handles the most frequent case of added notes, but in case of modified or deleted notes you may still have to&nbsp;delete unnecessary notes by hand.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="password_protection"> Password Protection</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><p class="note box hyphenate">This feature is only available to the PRO license holders.</p><p class="hyphenate">Since version 2.9, CintaNotes can protect your sensitive data and encrypt notebooks using the&nbsp;industry acclaimed AES-256 algorithm. The notebook will always remain encrypted on disk and will only be&nbsp;decrypted&nbsp;into memory when you enter the password.</p><p class="hyphenate">Currently the password protection feature works with whole notebooks only. It is not possible to encrypt only&nbsp;some notes in a notebook.</p><h3 id="password_protection-1">Setting the Password</h3><p class="hyphenate">To set the password for the current notebook, select the <em>File / Password Protection </em> command in the main&nbsp;menu. The following window will appear:</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2917 aligncenter" src="./help_files/password_change1.png" alt="password_change" width="479" height="384"></p><p class="hyphenate">Activate the <em>Protect this notebook with a password</em> checkbox and enter the desired password into the&nbsp;<em>New password</em> and <em>Confirm password</em> fields&nbsp;(you need to enter the password twice to minimize the risk of a typo).</p><p class="hyphenate">The controls below allow to configure password options and we'll examine them in a later section.</p><p class="hyphenate">Press OK and CintaNotes will report progress as it is encrypting the notebook.</p><p class="hyphenate">After the password is set, any access to the notebook when it is locked (more on this in a later section) will&nbsp;require entering the password like this:</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2920 aligncenter" src="./help_files/password_enter1.png" alt="password_enter" width="307" height="178"></p><p class="hyphenate">Note that instead of entering the password, you can press <em>Cancel</em> to minimize CintaNotes back to tray (in&nbsp;case you activated it by mistake, for example). You can also click on the <em>Notebook...&nbsp;</em>button to open another notebook.</p><h3 id="password_protection-2">Password Options</h3><p class="hyphenate">Now let's take a look which options are available for the password-protected notebooks.</p><p class="hyphenate">The radio buttons <em>Don't remember the password</em> and <em>Remember the password</em> allow you to choose&nbsp;between maximum security and convenience.</p><p class="hyphenate">By default CintaNotes will only keep the password in RAM and won't store it on disk. This means that the password&nbsp;is unrecoverable - if you forget the password, you lose access to your notes.</p><p class="hyphenate">This mode is the most secure option and should be preferred for the most sensitive data. However it can sometimes&nbsp;be not very convenient, because all background operations like cloud syncing&nbsp;and backup will not run until the password is entered and the notebook is unlocked - at least once after&nbsp;application started.</p><p class="hyphenate">However, if convenience is more important to you than security, you can choose the option to remember the&nbsp;password. In this case CintaNotes will store encrypted&nbsp;password hash on disk and will be able to run all background services even before you enter the password for the&nbsp;first time.</p><p class="warning box hyphenate">If you have portable CintaNotes in a synced folder, always use the "Don't remember password&nbsp;option", otherwise your password could be cracked remotely!</p><p class="hyphenate">On the positive side, when the option to remember the password is active, it is possible to reset forgotten&nbsp;password and reclaim access to your notes with the help of CintaNotes tech support.</p><p class="hyphenate">The <em>Lock and minimize to tray after X minutes of inactivity</em> controls the timeout after which you'll need&nbsp;to re-enter the password. When this option is active, CintaNotes tracks user activity, and&nbsp;after the specified period of user not being active in the program, automatically minimizes itself to tray and&nbsp;locks the notebook.</p><p class="hyphenate">The <em>Lock immediately after minimizing to tray</em> option allows you to manually lock the notebook simply by&nbsp;minimizing the application to tray.</p><p class="hyphenate">Please note that notebook is also automatically locked when the workstation is locked, so to lock the notebook&nbsp;you can also press Win+L.</p><h3 id="password_protection-3">Changing the Password</h3><p class="hyphenate">To change the password after it has been set, go to the same <em>File / Password Protection</em> window and click&nbsp;on the "Change Password" button.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2924 aligncenter" src="./help_files/password_change2.png" alt="password_change" width="479" height="384"></p><p class="hyphenate">The panel with the "New password" and "Confirm password" edit fields will appear. Enter the new password into&nbsp;them, then click on&nbsp;OK and re-enter the old password. After that the notebook will be re-encrypted with the new password.</p><h3 id="password_protection-4">Removing the Password</h3><p class="hyphenate">To remove the password and decrypt the current notebook, simply uncheck the "Protect this notebook with a&nbsp;password" checkbox in the&nbsp;"Password Protection" window. After clicking OK and entering the password for the last time, the notebook will&nbsp;be decrypted.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="pasting_to_other_apps"> Pasting Notes to Other Applications</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><p class="note box hyphenate">Pasting notes to other applications is a commercial feature available only to PRO license<br> holders.</p><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes allows you to extract the content of a note to another application running on your Windows PC.&nbsp;Pressing Ctrl+Enter or the middle mouse button will paste the currently selected note (or notes) into the&nbsp;Windows application that was running immediately prior to opening CintaNotes.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2928 aligncenter" src="./help_files/extract_note2.png" alt="extract_note" width="600" height="365"></p><p class="hyphenate">This feature is a great time saver when writing a report for example.

Otherwise, the selected text will become the link’s caption. Activating the link will open the file in the default application for this file type.</p><p class="note box hyphenate">If the file is located on an NTFS disk volume, the link will stay valid even when you move the file to a different folder. CintaNotes automatically tracks the file location and updates the link accordingly. However, this automatic tracking works only while the file remains on the same disk volume.</p><h3 id="notelinks-3">Links to Other Notes</h3><p class="note box hyphenate">Inserting links to other notes is a commercial feature available only to PRO license holders.</p><p class="hyphenate">Links to other notes can be added with the <em>Insert Link / Note</em> command in the context menu (or by pressing Alt+Shift+N). A search box will pop up, where you can type the target's note title or some title keywords. Having found the needed note, press Enter and the note link will be added. Here you also have the option of creating a new note as the link target.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-3613 aligncenter" src="./help_files/note_link_create3.png" alt="note_link_create" width="665" height="415"></p><p class="hyphenate">When no text is selected, CintaNotes will use the note title as the link text.

To use it, choose the command from the context menu of the note in the notes list and then paste the link from the clipboard into the needed note (Ctrl+V). Also when you copy a note to clipboard in the notes list, you can force pasting a link to it with the <em>Paste Note Link</em> command.</p><h3 id="notelinks-4">Retargeting Links</h3><p class="hyphenate">Any link caption can be freely edited and it won't affect the link target. The link target can be changed anytime manually by selecting the link and choosing the <em>Retarget Link</em> context menu command. A dialog box will pop up where you will be able to edit the link’s target.</p><p class="hyphenate">In most cases the link caption is updated automatically when the link target is modified. However, for links to web pages there’s one notable exception: if the link’s caption is different from the URL, the caption is not updated. This is useful for links embedded directly into the text flow.</p><h3 id="notelinks-5">Removing Links</h3><p class="hyphenate">If you want to completely remove a link, simply delete it with the usual text editing tools. To remove a link while leaving its caption in place, select it and use the <em>Delete Link</em> context menu command (Alt+Shift+D). The link will turn into plain text.</p><p class="hyphenate">In case the link's caption happens to be a valid URL itself, link caption will be removed as well.</p><h3 id="notelinks-6">Linking to Notes in Other Notebooks</h3><p class="hyphenate">Note Links can be used with multiple notebooks as well. For a link to a different notebook to work however, the&nbsp;notebook&nbsp;needs to be open; that is, it should be present in the notebook list of the <em>File</em> menu. Otherwise&nbsp;CintaNotes will have no way of knowing where to find the target notebook, and the link won't work.</p><h3 id="notelinks-7">Global Note Links</h3><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes also supports global note links: the links to CintaNotes notes which can be inserted into and&nbsp;activated from other programs. This feature can be used to integrate CintaNotes with other information&nbsp;management software.</p><p class="hyphenate">For these links to work, you need to register a CintaNotes instance with the system as the handler of the&nbsp;"cintanotes://" link protocol.&nbsp;Since this requires registry modification, you need to run CintaNotes as administrator and activate the&nbsp;<em>Options / System / Register Link Protocol</em> option.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2942 aligncenter" src="./help_files/note_link_global2.png" alt="note_link_global" width="596" height="443"></p><p class="hyphenate">To create a global note link, copy a link to a note with the <em>Copy Note Link</em> command (Alt+Shift+C) and&nbsp;paste this link into any application that supports links, such as Outlook, Word, or any rich-text enabled&nbsp;information manager. You can also use this link with web applications.</p><p class="hyphenate"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2945 aligncenter" src="./help_files/note_link_global_create2.png" alt="note_link_global_create" width="600" height="388"></p><p class="hyphenate">When the "cintanotes://" link protocol is registered with the system, clicking on such a link will activate&nbsp;CintaNotes which will open the target note. Please note that if there are multiple CintaNotes installations on&nbsp;the system, then the note's notebook should be open in the CintaNotes instance that has registered itself as the&nbsp;"cintanotes://" link handler — otherwise, the target note won't be found and the link won't work.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="export"> Exporting Notes</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><p class="hyphenate">CintaNotes supports note exporting in several ways:</p><ol><li><b>Unicode text file.</b> You can export notes from your notebook to a Unicode text file via the <em>File /&nbsp;Export</em> command.

After that a UAC&nbsp;prompt may appear which you should authorize to make changes to the computer, then click "Yes" to uninstall. The&nbsp;uninstall process is automatic and removes all files except the notebooks which were created by the user, and&nbsp;their backup copies.</p><h3 id="uninstalling-2">Portable Version</h3><p class="hyphenate">There's no automatic uninstall in the portable version. Just delete the CintaNotes folder and all shortcuts which&nbsp;you might have created.</p></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="faq"> FAQ</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><dl><dt class="faq">Does CintaNotes support Unicode?</dt><dd>Yes, CintaNotes is fully Unicode-compliant and actually stores all text data in Unicode. But you have to&nbsp;make&nbsp;sure that the fonts used to display notes include the needed character sets. With the default fonts there is&nbsp;usually&nbsp;no problem.</dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">Will there be a version of CintaNotes with UI in my native language?</dt><dd>CintaNotes already supports a large number of languages, you can see the whole list of them in the&nbsp;<em>Options / Language</em> menu. If your language is not in the list, please read the <em>Configuring&nbsp;CintaNotes&nbsp;/ Selecting UI Language</em> section on what you can do in this situation.</dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">How do I select multiple notes?</dt><dd>Use Ctrl+click, or Shift-Up/Down key combinations. Also if you navigate the list while holding the Ctrl key,&nbsp;you can toggle the selection on the current note with the spacebar.</dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">How can I change the text-capturing hotkey from default Ctrl+F12 to something else?</dt><dd><span class="todo">Use the <em>Options / Hot Keys</em> command.</span></dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">How can I change the search mode in the search box without using the mouse?</dt><dd><span class="todo">Press Ctrl+F and then Alt+Down to display the menu (or you can press&nbsp;Ctrl+Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown to switch search modes one-by-one).</span></dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">What programming language is CintaNotes written in?</dt><dd>CintaNotes is written in Visual C++ and builds on top of pure Window API calls. No libraries like .NET or&nbsp;MFC&nbsp;are used, this is what enables CintaNotes to take full control of resource usage and remain fast, lean, and&nbsp;self-contained.</dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">What does "Cinta" mean?</dt><dd>In Spanish, "la cinta" means "band" (or "tape"). In a sense, this is similar to the way CintaNotes&nbsp;represents&nbsp;notes: as a list. And, well, we just thought it would be a nice name ;-)</dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">Is there a Linux or Mac version?</dt><dd>Unfortunately no. CintaNotes relies heavily on Windows API, so porting it to other platforms seems&nbsp;unfeasible&nbsp;at the moment.</dd></dl><dl><dt class="faq">How can I report a bug?</dt><dd>If you're encountering problems with CintaNotes please go to <a href="http://cintanotes.com/">http://cintanotes.com</a>&nbsp;and make sure that you're running the latest version of&nbsp;CintaNotes. If the problem is with the latest version, please report it on our <a href="http://cintanotes.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=6">Bug Reports</a> forum. We strive to deliver&nbsp;high-quality software&nbsp;and keep CintaNotes as bug-free as possible, so we and all other CintaNotes users will greatly appreciate&nbsp;your&nbsp;contribution.</dd></dl></div></div></div><div rel="bookmark"><h2 class="title" id="keys"> Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts</h2><div class="entry"><div class="excerpt"><h3 id="keys-1">System-Wide</h3><dl><dt>Ctrl+F12</dt><dd>Capture selected text from active application as a new note.
